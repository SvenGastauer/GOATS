# Expert Group: GlObal Assessment of Target Strength (GOATS); first meeting WGFAST Iceland, 6th April 2025  

## Terms on reference  

a)	Development of Standardised Meta-Data Fields
The expert group will design and standardise a set of meta-data fields for documenting target strength values across datasets. These fields will ensure consistency by capturing essential parameters, including measurement methods, environmental conditions, geographic location, and the specific equipment used in the data collection process.
b)	Species-Specific Meta-Data Fields
The expert group will create meta-data fields for each species for which target strength data has been derived. These fields will include, but are not limited to, morphometric data (e.g., size, shape) and physiological information (e.g., swimbladder characteristics), providing a comprehensive description of species-specific factors that influence target strength.
c)	Centralisation of Target Strength Data
The expert group will compile, standardise, and centralise existing target strength data using the established meta-data fields. This data will be organised into a searchable, user-friendly database designed for easy access. The group will also implement a system for the ongoing maintenance, review, and update of the database, ensuring that it remains accurate, relevant, and up-to-date.
d)	Evaluation of Applications and Promotion of Acoustic Methods
The expert group will assess the various applications of target strength in fisheries and ecosystem acoustics. The group will focus on promoting the use of acoustic methods in these areas to a broader audience. Additionally, the expert group will document the target strength values used in ICES fisheries acoustics surveys, facilitating easier reference, validation, and comparison across surveys and regions.
Expected deliverables
a)	Peer-reviewed publication and/or CRR
b)	Online database or similar containing target strength values
